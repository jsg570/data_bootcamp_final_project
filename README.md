Project Description

The project aims to examines the effects of the 2004-2005 hand-checking rule on NBA players. Many of the older generation of players have cited this rule as one of reasons the game is much less physical and why it is easier to score in today's NBA. The project shows the effect of the Hand-checking rule on three statistical measures: points per game (PPG), field goal percentage (FG%), and true shooting percentage (TS%). The first, a measure of the a players ability to score, while the latter two are stastics related to efficiency in scoring. For this project, only players who are within the ages of 21-35 in the given seasons are used in the sample to eliminate the first few and last few years (on average poor scoring years) of a players career, and keep the sample consistent. These statistics are plotted on a graph against the years 1998 to 2011 to see if the hand-checking rule truly had any changes to the NBA.
