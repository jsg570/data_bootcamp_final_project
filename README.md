# data_bootcamp_final_project
Final project for Data Bootcamp 2019

This project was completed by Jarred Go in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2019. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknolwedged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others-including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative, expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotations marks), or para-phrasing thereof - has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography. 

And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substationally similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a differetn semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknolwedge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.
